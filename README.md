# Digital-Logic
In this course, students take an overview of several ideas, parts and tools as well as an introduction to digital electronics. We were keep up-to-date to the fundamental ideas of digital to programmable logic circuits that were be covered detail in this subject.

#### Lab 1 : Combinational Logic Circuit
This lab emphasised on a number of practice problems relating to combinational logic circuit testing and breadboarding.

#### Lab 2 : Combinational Logic Circuit Design Simulation (Deeds)
We produced digital logic circuit, generating truth table and timing diagram as well as exposed to a complete cycle process of a combinatioal circuit design and simulate using Deeds Simulator App.

#### Lab 3 : Synchronous Digital Counter
We implemented a synchronous counter circuit from Deed Simulation apps into physical circuit using Breadboards, Flip-Flops, Basic Gates and Switches. We also completed the next-state table, sketch the state diagram and identify the properties of the counter circuit.

# REFLECTION
<details>
<summary>Reflection</summary>
This course helped me to understand how computers work inside. I gained knowledge about gates, circuits and how to make things with binary numbers. Even though this course was new to me, I always looking forward to use this knowledge to create more exciting things in the future!
