# Digital-Logic
Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the students to digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts, components, and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from basic concepts to programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on experience with the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the classroom.

#### Lab 1 : Combinational Logic Circuit
This lab emphasised on a number of practice problems relating to combinational logic circuit testing and breadboarding.

#### Lab 2 : Combinational Logic Circuit Design Simulation (Deeds)
We produced digital logic circuit, generating truth table and timing diagram as well as exposed to a complete cycle process of a combinatioal circuit design and simulate using Deeds Simulator App.

#### Lab 3 : Synchronous Digital Counter

# REFLECTION
<details>
<summary>Reflection</summary>
This course helped me to understand how computers work inside. I gained knowledge about gates, circuits and how to make things with binary numbers. Even though this course was new to me, I always looking forward to use this knowledge to create more exciting things in the future!
